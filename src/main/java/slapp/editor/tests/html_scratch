    "<p><h3>Derivation Exercises</h3></p>" +
    "<p>A derivation exercise typically begins with premise(s) at the top, and a conclusion at the bottom.  You will not be able to modify the concluding formula and, in the ordinary case, you will not be able to modify either a premise or its justification.</p> " +
	    "<ol><li>There is a vertical slider bar to adjust the width of formula fields.  In addition you can change the width of a derivation window by its width spinner.  Move within a derivation by the mouse and/or Enter/Return, Ctrl/Cmd-up, -down, -right, -left (Ctrl/Cmd optional for -up, -down).  After that, buttons on the left are reasonably straightforward:<br><br></li>" +
            "<ul><li>The 'insert line' button inserts a line above the current line (at current scope depth), and 'delete line' removes the current line.<br><br></li>" +
            "<li>The 'insert subder' button adds lines for a new subderivation just above the current line, and 'insert subders' adds lines for a pair of subderivations above the current line (as for &#x2194;I or &#x2228;E). <br><br></li>
            "<li>It is possible to modify or generate suberivations 'by hand' using the 'indent line', 'outdent line', 'add shelf' and 'add gap' buttons.  The indent button increases the scope of the current line by one; outdent reduces it by one.  Add shelf inserts a small shelf beneath the current line, and add gap inserts a gap just below the current line.  Removing a line removes a shelf or gap beneath it.<br><br></li>" +
            "<li>Once you enter line numbers for a justification, the numbers in the justification are automatically adjusted as you insert and delete lines above.<br><br>" +
            "<i>*For this reason, it is good practice to enter justifications of lines that depend on ones above as soon as the relevant lines exist with numbers.</i> For example, if a line <i>L</i> is to be justified by a suberivation, you can enter the justification for <i>L</i> when that suberivation is first set up, rather than waiting until the suberivation is complete -- and let SLAPP manage justification numbers as lines are inserted or deleted.<br><br></li></ul>" +
        "<li>SLAPP will attempt to link and adjust any number that is part of a justification.  In the vast majority of cases, this is just what you want.  But, in some cases, you want a justification to include a fixed number (as for a theorm or axiom number, as T6.15 or A8).  Then the fixed number must be distinct from that of any line.  Since line numbers are always whole numbers, this happens automatically if the justification number contains a 'point'.  If there is no natural point in the justification number, you can distinguish the justification number from the line numbers by adding a leading point or zero (A.8 or A08).</li></ol>"
